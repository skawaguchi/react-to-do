# React To Do App

## Usage

### Installing the App

If you have `yarn` installed:

Run `yarn`.

Otherwise, run `npm i`.

This app also requires Node 8+. This is because it uses the [Parcel Bundler](https://parceljs.org/). If you have NVM, simply type `nvm use`. Otherwise you will only be able to load the `./dist/index.html` file in a browser directly.

### Running the App

To run the app in the browser, run `yarn start`. 

You can also run the most recent distribution version by simply opening `dist/index.html` in a browser.

### Running Tests
To run the tests once, run `yarn test`. 

To run the tests in watch mode while developing, run `yarn test:watch`.

### Building the Production Release
To run the tests once, run `yarn build`. This will update the `./dist` directory. Simply open `./dist/index.html` in any browser and the application should run.
